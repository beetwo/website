Humanitarian organisations often struggle to access real-time information about the urgent needs in an emergency situation, especially at times of rapid change. Sometimes, several organisations duplicate their efforts to solve the same issues, while others aren’t reached at all.

[//]: #Toucan is an online emergency relief platform. It enables communication among humanitarian actors and facilitates sharing information and coordinating resources, whether supplying food or urgent medical assistance. Organisations become more aware of who provides what services where.

It was developed as a result of a hackathon with the input of NGOs working with refugees in Macedonia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia, and the International Director of Emergency Response at SOS-Children’s Village International.

Toucan is now in use in Greece for organisations working with refugees.
