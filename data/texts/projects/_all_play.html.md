Playability and Sociability

One special feature of Inclusive Playground Design is to generate diversity:
Attractive for visitors of all ages and abilities (including different social classes, cultures, children and adults with or without disabilities)

Inspiring open play spaces encourage children's physical activity and stimulate intuitive play, exploration, and creativity.

- Child development and Learning (motor skills; social-emotional skills: autonomy, selfdetermination; cognitive/intellectual development)
- Social Interaction (communication, interactive play)
- Recreation (regeneration and stress reduction)
- Public Health (fostering physical and mental health and well-being)
