The Mobility Makeathon explored how digital manufacturing could revolutionise wheelchair design and transform lives.
 
Over 65 million people worldwide are in need of a wheelchair to lead an independent life and play an active role in society. To maximise its user’s freedom and potential a wheelchair should be both bespoke and lightweight. The costs of traditional manufacturing render such wheelchairs unaffordable for most people – however, new technology (e.g. 3D printing, CNC milling, laser cutting) could be the answer to this problem.
The Mobility Makeathon hosted by BeeTwo at the Happylab Vienna on the 19th and 20th February, explored how digital manufacturing could revolutionise wheelchair design and help to transform millions of lives. Since February  HackOnWheels  has continued innovating wheelchair design.
