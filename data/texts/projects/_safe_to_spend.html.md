Safe to Spend

Quick overview of your account balance

Safe to Spend was developed for clients of Zweite Sparkasse. To make their personal budgeting easier, Safe to Spend allows its users a quick overview on their account balance. The idea of „Safe to Spend“ is based on “QuickCheck”, an app, which  gives a quick overview of your account balance without having to log in. BeeTwo therefore takes “QuickCheck” further and gives an overview of your available budget subtracting your fixed costs, until the transfer of the next salary or social benefit occurs.
