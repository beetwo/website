Toucan is an online emergency relief platform.  It enables communication among humanitarian actors in emergency situations. Toucan facilitates sharing Information and coordinating resources, whether supplying Food or urgent medical assistance.

It was developed with the Input of NGOs working with refugees in Macedonia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia, and the International Director of Emergency Response at SOS-Children’s Village International.\

**Why Toucan?**

A lot of Tools exist for NGOs to communicate with each other, yet none are tailored to their needs.\
Facebook and WhatsApp lead to Long communication threads, no priorisation of issues, no map view, no closing of issues, no safe environment.

**Project Status:**

Toucan is now in use in Greece for oranisations working with refugees.
