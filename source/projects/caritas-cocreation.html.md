We listen to and co-create with social initiatives to gain a deep insight into societal challenges.

The innovation department of Caritas Wien serves as a project development unit for Caritas. 
They invite BeeTwo to participate in their processes on a regular basis. 
Both the experience of such a large social service organisation and the know-how of BeeTwo form the basis of a winning team. Together we are coming up with real concepts for innovative solutions concerning issues in the social sector.
