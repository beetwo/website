The idea of „Safe to Spend“ is based on 
[“QuickCheck”](https://www.sparkasse.at/sgruppe/Privatkunden/Services/E-Banking/Apps/QuickCheck-App), 
an app, which gives a quick overview of your account balance without having to log in. 
Clients of [Zweite Sparkasse](http://www.erstestiftung.org/project/die-zweite-sparkasse/)
have greater difficulties in their personal budgeting. BeeTwo therefore takes 
[“QuickCheck”](https://www.sparkasse.at/sgruppe/Privatkunden/Services/E-Banking/Apps/QuickCheck-App) 
further and gives an overview of your available 
budget subtracting your fixed costs, until the transfer of the next salary or social benefit occurs.
