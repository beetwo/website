Play is about fun, creative learning, interaction and making friends. 
And as we all like to play let us re-imagine attractive playable spaces and inspiring playgrounds! 
Let us re-imagine the ideal public open-space considering playability and sociability, where all of us have a place; 
where children and adults of different ability levels, regardless of their cultural and social background, 
are brought together, that is accessible for everyone, where all can spend valuable time and are inspired to play!


Impact Hub Cluj Napoca and BeeTwo invited parents, designers, architects, IT experts, artists, psychologists and educators to create an inclusive open playscape for Cluj!
The makeathon focused on designing (temporary or fixed) integrative outdoor structures that can be placed anywhere in the city. 
The resulting designs ranged from sound installations to water parks to enormous robots and fierce dragons.
