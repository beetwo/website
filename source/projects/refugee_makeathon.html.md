At the Refugee Hackathon on February 15 hosted at The Connection, 
BeeTwo and SOS-Childrenâ€™s Villages International brought together developers and NGOs, 
working with refugees along the Balkan in Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, 
to come up with solutions on how digital platforms can support the cooperation between NGOs across countries.

 
After a day of fruitful discussion and brainstorming, to enhance the efficiency and cooperation 
between NGOs across borders, the concept of a platform was brought forward. 
This platform would be presented in the form of an intuitive map allowing organizations to create specific 
issues on topics such as medical supplies, legal questions, and food delivery in their location of choice. 
Organizations would then be able to take on an issue within these topics. 
A chat option within the platform would additionally allow NGOs to discuss and collaborate.
