Over 65 million people worldwide need a wheelchair to lead an independent life 
and play an active role in society. 
To maximise its user’s freedom and potential, a wheelchair should be both bespoke and lightweight. 
The costs of traditional manufacturing render such wheelchairs unaffordable for most people 
–however, new technology (e.g. 3D printing, CNC milling, laser cutting) could be the answer to this problem.

The Mobility Makeathon hosted by BeeTwo at the Happylab Vienna on the 19th and 20th February, 
explored how digital manufacturing could revolutionise wheelchair design and help to transform millions of lives.
Since February HackOnWheels has continued innovating wheelchair design.
